Assignment 4: Methods Section
================
DAR
Spring 2024

One goal of this course is to provide you the opportunity analyze your
own data and/or use statistical methods that you think might help
advance understanding of the system or process you study. This
assignment is intended to help you focus on proposing and writing a
Methods section that will later support the Results in Assignment 6.

First, consider the data you plan to analyze and/or the statistical
method you plan to use. Some students have data and need to identify an
appropriate model, while others might not have data and want to learn a
specific model for which they can find data. From there, make sure your
methods section includes the following

1.  Start with a clear question. Your question will not necessarily be
    graded on merit, but it will be graded based on how well it aligns
    to your statistical or analytical approach. (20 points)

2.  Describe the data you will be working with. This might just take a
    sentence or two, or could take a paragraph. Please describe the data
    so that a naive user could understand it, but no more. Cite
    references or redundant information about the data if you did not
    collect it. (20 points)

3.  Include the model or approach that you plan to use to answer your
    question. In most cases, you will use a model, but I am open-minded
    to what you can do to analyze your data. (So please come see me if
    you have an idea.) The primary requirement is that it needs to be a
    model (or clearly and directly related to a model) that we covered
    in class (20 points). I cannot grade models or approaches that we
    did not go over in class, even if they might be better for your
    data. Include justification as to why you picked your analysis (20
    points), and include statistical notation of whatever model or
    approach you describe (20 points).

### Deliverable

Your deliverable will be a Methods section of a manuscript, which may be
as concise as one page or take a few pages. You are welcome to write
this in MS Word and not Markdown. This assignment is **due uploaded to
Moodle by 5pm April 1, 2024.**
