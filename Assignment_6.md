Assignment 6: Results Section
================
DAR
Spring 2024

For your final assignment, you will be further developing Assignment 4
for into a results section. The intention of this assignment is to draft
the middle part of a manuscript: the Methods and Results sections (while
**not** including the other sections).

**This assignment accounts for 25% of your course grade.**

### Contents

- 20 points: Methods. Include a revised version of your Methods
  (Assignment 4) that provides your question, data, model (with
  justification), and equation in statistical notation. We discussed in
  class numerous ways to improve and tighten up the methods.
- 30 points: Describe the results of your analysis. What did the models
  produce? Was there any summary information that helps describe the
  dataset? Typically, Results sections benefit from moving from the
  broad to the specific. Also, be sure to report a result on everything
  you included in the Methods. Reference any tables or figures that you
  have made; however, this point allocation will be entirely dependent
  on the text of the Results. **Do not interpret your results.**
- 30 points: Figures. Create at least 2 figures that were made in R and
  have stand-alone captions. Additional figures and tables are welcomed;
  however, more tables and figures does not necessarily mean more points
  as you will do better with 2 or 3 excellent figures instead of 4 or 5
  poor figures.  
- 10 points: Grammar and writing. I do not intend to be a stickler on
  this, but at the graduate level, it is expected that you are a
  proficient writer. Please reference books on writing and have
  classmates, labmates, and/or me review your writing if you have any
  questions.
- 10 points: Format. Please prepare this document such that you would be
  submitting it to a scientific journal. I am not prescribing specific
  formats, other than to say it needs to be clean, clear, and organized.
  Look at examples of peer-reviewed literature for how Methods and
  Results are reported. (Hint: some journals even even have templates
  that you could check out.) One of the biggest helps in formatting is
  to remember to be consistent.

**I would strongly encourage you to focus on addressing the above points
and not worry about document length.**

### Deliverable

You are encouraged to use MS Word due to the familiarity most of you
have and the control over which you can format the contents; however,
you are allowed to use Markdown or anything else you prefer. **Please
upload your document to Moodle by 5pm Friday, May 3, 2024.**
