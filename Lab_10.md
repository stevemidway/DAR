Exercise 10: 2-min teach
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2024

For our final lab exercise of the semester please make a short video in
the style of TikTok, no more than 2 minutes in duration, in which you
teach a (simple) concept in R. You will be graded based on the clarity
of the concept taught, so do not try to overload your video with
multiple concepts or multiple steps. For example, instead of teaching
how to do a linear regression, maybe use a minute to explain why we need
to examine model residuals and then show how to do it. Or, show off a
fancy `geom` in `ggplot2`. I am not expecting high production quality,
but the audio needs to be audible and the video needs to be clear.
Consider captions. Please see me if you have questions or ideas about
content that you need feedback on.

**Please upload to Moodle a video file or document with a link to view
by 9am Thursday April 18, 2024. The document may be whatever file you
like: MS Word, etc.**
