Exercise 5: Distributions Everywhere
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2025

This exercise is simple: list 15 examples of data coming from different
distributions. Include five (5) examples each from the normal, Poisson,
and binomial distribution. Also, please limit no more than two (2) of
the examples to those from your research or other scientific examples.
In other words, I would like most of the examples to be real-world data
you encounter or now see because you are thinking about distributions.
For example, the number of trucks that accumulate behind at a red light
might be Poisson, and the number of calories you eat over a weekâ€™s worth
of dinners might be normally distributed.

**Deliverable: Using something simple like a Word document, create a
heading for the three distributions and enumerate your 5 examples under
each. Please upload an file to Moodle by 9am Monday, March 17.**
