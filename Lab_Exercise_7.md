Exercise 7: Bad Figures
================
DAR
Spring 2025

For this exercise you will need to review the published literature,
preferably in your area of expertise. Please find two separate figures
that have something objectively wrong with them, based on the criteria
we discussed in class. Please focus on real improvements that could be
made, and not subjective or aesthetic changes. Put a copy of each figure
on a separate page of a Word document, include the citation of the paper
from which you found it, and include some text and/or bullet points
about what you have objectively identified as needing to be corrected.
Your final document should be a 2-page assignment.

**Deliverable: Please upload your document (preferably a Word document)
to Moodle by 9am Monday, April 21.**
