Exercise 8: Infographics
================
DAR
Spring 2025

### The task

Each student will produce one infographic on a topic of their choosing
(i.e., it could be your own research or a topic you are unfamiliar with
but would like to learn about).

### Guidance

1.  You all have access to a professional account in
    [Venngage](https://venngage.com/). See the Venngage website and
    video tutorials (in addition to what we will talk about in class)
    for strategies on designing an effective Infographic.

2.  A quick Googling can produce many good examples of infographics.
    Venngage also provides templates and ideas for starting
    infographics.

3.  Regarding content, you may use just about anything. Feel free to use
    something from your own research or a science-related topic you are
    learning about. I am not opposed to creating an infographic that is
    less based on results and more based on methods. Good data analysis
    relies on good data collection, so therefore if you would like to
    create an infographic that is methodological (i.e., *how to*), you
    may do that with instructor permission.

4.  Regardless of the topic you choose, you are required to include 2
    quantitative elements represented in your infographic. Including a
    single number or value does **not** count as a quantitative element.
    You are **not** encouraged to make detailed figures in R, either.
    Rather, a quantitative element is something that conveys
    quantitative information graphically (think: comparisons, ranks,
    group membership, etc.). Please contact me if you have questions
    about what counts as a quantitative element. Your quantitative
    elements constitute a large part of how the assignment will be
    graded.

**Deliverable: Although you are not required to use Venngage, please let
me know if you plan on using another software. Upload your Infographic
(preferably in PDF format) by 9am on April 30.**
