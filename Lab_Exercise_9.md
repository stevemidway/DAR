Exercise 9: Reporting
================
DAR
Spring 2025

### Model Reporting

The goal of this exercise is to practice reporting what you did in an
analysis, in terms of Methods and Results. For this exercise, run a
simple linear regression using `age` as a predictor of `circumference`
for the `Orange` data set that is available in R (and loaded
automatically when you start an R session). I recognize that a simple
linear regression might not be the perfect model for this; however, this
relationship will work well enough for the model and the intention of
this exercise is entirely on reporting a model–not necessarily on the
study system.

Prepare a written document (can be Word, html, etc.) that contains a
Methods and Results section for the above analysis. Because the data and
model are simple, you don’t need to write a lot. For example, the
Methods section might just be two paragraphs: one describing the data
and one describing the model. The Results section might only be one or
two paragraphs. Please do not write any more than is needed, but focus
on clear, concise reporting. Use the reference checklist handed out in
class to consider the scope of your reporting. (Remember, not everything
on the checklist will apply.)

**Deliverable: Upload your Reporting document by 9am on May 5.**
