**This syllabus represents a good-faith agreement between what I propose to cover in this course in exchange for your attendance, attention, and best possible effort, all of which are signified by your enrollment.**

### Course Description

This course is designed to give advanced undergraduates and graduate students an overview of contemporary data analytic approaches in the field of marine science, and broadly the natural sciences. In addition to building comprehension and understanding of a range of statistical models commonly used in marine science and ecological research, the course will be bookended on the front by concepts of data management (curation, metadata development, exploratory analyses), and conclude with topics having to do with effective data visualization, archiving, and other steps in the data life cycle. All topics will be taught in the versatile and developing language of R.

### Course Objectives

1.  Understand and command the process of data analysis from pre-analysis to post-analysis
2.  Develop quantiative methods and knowledge of when to apply them in order to analyze data

### Prerequisite(s)

No required prerequisites, although a basic understanding of statistics, data, and program R is beneficial.

### Course Materials

All course materials will be distributed via email or in the course repository on Github: <https://github.com/stevemidway/DAR>

Lecture notes and materials will not be posted in the same form as presented in class; however, the companion book for the course will have reference information for nearly all of the lectures and materials can be added upon request. Access the companion text here: <https://bookdown.org/steve_midway/DAR/>

### Computing

You are expected to bring a laptop to class. Although there may be days we do not use computers, it is best to anticipate using one, or to ask the prior class period about the need. Computers should be loaded with program `R`, ideally run through R Studio.

-   Program R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   R Studio: <https://www.rstudio.com/>

*Mid-term grades will include the Data Management Plan and Database Development Assignments, representing 25% of your course grade.*

### Assignments and Grade Distribution

-   **Data Management Plan (10%)**: Each student will write their own Data Management Plan detailing the preparation of data before a project, handling of data during the project, and the long-term curation of the data.

-   **Database Development (15%)**: In teams of 3, each student will contribute at least one freely-available marine science database, linked using functions in R, with other datasets provided by group members. The objective is to create a new database from merged information. Code and writeup will be produced.

-   **Statistical Modeling (20%)**: Each student will complete a 10 question assignment that will focus on modeling (in R) marine science data and rely on generalized linear models and other techniques covered in lecture. Code and writeup will be produced.

-   **Methods (15%)**: Each student will produce a Methods sections on the data analysis they plan to undertake for their final research paper. Traditionally, the Methods section was only included in the final assignment, but is now an independent assignment so that it can be focused on separate from the Results, and feedback can be provided for improvement. 

-   **Infographic (15%)**: Each student will produce 1 infographic on a science topics of their choosing (i.e., it could be your own research and a topic you are unfamiliar with but would like to learn about).

-   **Final Analysis (25%)**: Each student will produce either a Methods and Results section representing an analysis they have undertaken. Data may be used from existing research projects outside of class. Code and writeup will be produced. The Methods section should be based on the previous assignment.

**Each graded assignment will have its own guidelines contained in a separate document.**

### Course Policies

#### General

-   Attendance will not be taken, although you are strongly encouraged to attend every class. Some material will be presented only in class, so if you miss a lecture, please make sure you have a classmate or proxy you can trust to get the notes. Please see me for any absences due to extenuating circumstances.

-   As a rule, late assignments will not be accepted without *a priori* conditions established between the professor and student. i.e., **Assignments not handed in on time result in a 0.**

-   Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for absence. It is also the absentee’s responsibility to get all missing notes or materials. You are responsible for anything discussed in lecture. I do not necessarily make everything available a second time, as on Moodle.

-   Exams are closed book, closed notes.

-   No makeup quizzes or exams will be given. The only exception falls under the category of a university-approved excused absence. See me with questions.

-   Some assignments will require writing. Please rely on classmates or LSU Writing Support for help (<https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/studios/studio151/writing>), or see me.

-   The university student time expectation is 1:3. This means for every hour you are in class, 3 hours of work outside of class are expected to fulfill the learning outcomes. This may vary per topic or week, but please keep this expectation in mind--I do.

### Communication

-   I will do my best to get back to comments and questions as soon as possible, and the best way to reach me is by email. I will generally get back to you within one day and will do my best to let you know if I will be away for an extended period. I am often in my office if not teaching.

-   Please silence all phones and mobile devices while in class.

### Disability Services

-   Louisiana State University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. If you have a disability for which you may require accommodations, you are required to register with Disability Services (115 Johnston Hall; 225-578-5919). Students that receive accommodation letters, please meet with me to discuss the provisions of those accommodations as soon as possible.

### Academic Honesty Policy

-   Students who violate the LSU Code of Student Conduct (<https://saa.lsu.edu/code>) will be referred to Student Advocacy and Accountability. Academic misconduct at LSU includes but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to give an unfair academic advantage to the student. The outcome will range from failing the assignment to failing the class. Suspension from LSU is the common outcome for multiple academic violations. Cheating (loosely defined as plagiarism, lying, and other similar behaviors) will absolutely not be tolerated. That being said, there are often gray areas when it comes to citations and other collaborative actions, so please ask me anything about which you are remotely curious. *I can almost promise you that any question or concern you have will be easier to deal with than the outcome of cheating.*

### Classroom Safety

-   Although college classrooms remain one of the safest places in the US, there always exists the threat of violence in the classroom. I will always do my best to protect any student while they are in my class; however, preparedness by everyone increases the chance of a good outcome in a bad situation. To this end, there are a number of resources we can take advantage of to better prepare ourselves.

### Calendar of Material

The following topics are approximately in the order we will cover them as many are concepts that will build on previous work. We may make modifications to the topics as the course materials develop, and we will devote varying amounts of time to each topic, based on interest and capacity.
